## Todo

- [ ] Get off of the CSV dictionary and on the main protobuf one
- [ ] Integrate Tatoeba example sentences, pre-ranked

## Ideas

- Should I split each sentence by line to make reading easier?
- Can have a bar visualization under each source with the amount of words per
  HSK level or percentile, e.g.:
  `|--HSK1--|--HSK2--|---HSK3---|`
